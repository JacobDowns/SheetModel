"""
Class to compute time dependent coefficients and truncation error for a k-th order 
BDF method (k <= 5).

phi(t) is the interpolating polynomial that passes through 
(t0, y0), (t1, y1), ... , (t5, y5).
phidot(t) is the derivative of the interpolating polynomial wrt t. It can be written
in terms of divided differences as
phidot(t) = [y0, y1] + [y0, y1, y2](t0-t1) + [y0, y1, y2, y3](t0-t1)(t0-t2) + ...
which can be rewritten as a linear cominbation of y0 ... yn
